# Feature Backlog

Proposed enhancements for Schema Builder. Ordered by impact within each
group; each item lists the rationale and the smallest sensible scope.

## Core functionality (highest leverage)

1. **Definition Editor in the frontend** — Currently definitions can only
   be uploaded as raw JSON via POST. A form-based editor with live
   validation against the Pydantic schema, examples/options chips, and a
   preview closes the largest UX gap.
2. **Interactive field mapping by click** — User selects text / a region
   in `DocumentViewer`; the backend stores the bounding box as an
   additional training example on the definition. Closes the loop
   between extraction and definition improvement.
3. **Bounding-box overlay on rendered pages** — Today matches surface
   only as text in `FieldsPanel`. Highlights drawn on the page PNG
   (hover-linked to the field row) make `match_reason` / `match_score`
   tangible.
4. **Target-table export endpoint** — `target_tables` with transforms is
   already modeled but never executed. Add
   `GET /api/documents/{id}/export?format=csv|json|parquet` to complete
   the workflow.

## Robustness & operations

5. **Batch extraction** — `POST /api/extract/batch` across many docs
   with Server-Sent Events for progress. The existing concurrency
   semaphore already bounds this.
6. **Persisted extraction results** — Each `/extract` recomputes from
   scratch. SQLite cache keyed on `(doc_id, definition_hash)` removes
   the expensive path on re-visits.
7. **Authentication + multi-user** — At minimum, an API-token scheme so
   `/api/definitions` isn't publicly writable in any real deployment.
8. **Document upload endpoint** — `test_documents/` is static today.
   `POST /api/documents` with size / MIME validation reusing
   `SCHEMABUILDER_MAX_BODY_BYTES`.

## Extraction quality

9. **Per-field confidence thresholds** — Today the best match always
   wins. Configurable minimum-score threshold per field plus a "review
   needed" indicator when matches are borderline.
10. **LLM fallback** — When the rule-based `match_reason` paths
    (`example_exact`, `date_format`, `option_substring`) return nothing,
    optionally call the Claude API with the field description + page
    text. Cache by `(doc, field, page)`.
11. **Regex / format slot on fields** — Alongside `examples` and
    `available_options`, add a `pattern` slot (IBAN, VAT-ID, ISO date)
    as an additional match reason.

## DX / UX

12. **Definition version diff view** — Keep a revision on every PATCH,
    show side-by-side diff in the UI.
13. **Dark mode + keyboard navigation** between pages / fields.
14. **OpenAPI client generation in CI** to replace the hand-maintained
    `frontend/src/services/api.js`.

Status: ideas captured 2026-05-11. Shipped on branch
`claude/suggest-project-features-HguxY`:
- #1 Definition Editor (Carbon modal + form, preserves extras)
- #2 Click-to-teach (overlay every text entry on the page; clicking
  opens a modal that appends the value to a chosen field's
  `examples`; the next extract re-runs automatically)
- #3 Bounding-box overlay (persistent ghost overlays for every match,
  reverse hover into FieldsPanel, label on active)
- #4 Target-table export (transform engine + JSON/CSV download)
- #9 Per-field confidence thresholds (`min_confidence` 0–1 on each
  field overrides the default 0.5 cutoff; the editor exposes it as a
  percent input; sub-threshold candidates surface as a "review" hint
  in the panel instead of being silently dropped)
